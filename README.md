# CommunityLevelRiskComp

This repository contains the code for our analysis examining variable HIV PrEP coverage and community-level behavioral differences. This study examined the association between community-level PrEP use and five behavioral risk indicators to determine whether behavioral change at a community-level is occurring independent of individual-level PrEP-related behavioral changes among US MSM.
